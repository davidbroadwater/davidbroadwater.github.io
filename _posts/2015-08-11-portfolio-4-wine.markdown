title: Data Analysis with R:<br>What Chemical Properties Influence the Quality of Red Wine?
description: |
  <p class="lead">Wine is one of the oldest and most popular alcohol beverages in the world, with hundreds of different varieties produced around the world. While not as well known in the US, Vinho Verde wine is produced from a specific region in Portugal, ranging from white to red varieties. Roughly 1600 different Vinho Verde red wines were measured for their chemical properties (such as alcohol content, residual sugar, density, etc.), along with a blind "quality" rating from three wine experts. In order to determine which chemical properties had the biggest influence on wine quality, R was used to explore the various relationships in the dataset. All of the analysis was done stream-of-consciousness style, in order to explain the thought process used along the way.<br><br>To find out which chemical properties had the biggest influence on quality, you can <a target="_blank" href="http://broadwater.io/data-analysis-with-R/">read my analysis here</a>, or look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidbroadwater/data-analysis-with-r">code used</a> to create it.
