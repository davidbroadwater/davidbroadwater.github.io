title: Data Analysis with R:<br>What Chemical Properties Influence the Quality of Red Wine?
description: |
  <p class="lead">Roughly 1600 different Vinho Verde red wines from Portugal were measured for their chemical properties (such as alcohol content, residual sugar, density, etc.), along with a blind "quality" rating from three wine experts. For this project, R was used to explore the various relationships in the dataset and determine which chemical properties had the biggest influence on wine quality. All of the analysis was documented stream-of-consciousness style, in order to explain the thought process used along the way.<br><br>To find out which chemical properties had the biggest influence on quality, you can <a target="_blank" href="http://broadwater.io/data-analysis-with-R/">read my analysis here</a>, or look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidbroadwater/data-analysis-with-r">code used</a> to create it. This project was completed as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002">Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree</a>.<br><br> Skills used: R, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Multivariate Analysis, Statistics.</p>
