title: Analyzing the Enron Email Dataset:<br>Is it possible to use machine learning to identify persons of interest in the Enron fraud case?
description: |
  <p class="lead"> Enron was the source of one of the largest corporate fraud cases in history. Much of the information involved in the case has been released publicly, including actual emails sent by Enron employees and financial compensation information for many Enron employees. Is it possible to use machine learning algorithms to exploit relationships and patterns in that data to identify persons of interest (POIs) in the fraud case? This project involved determining the best information (or features) to use in the financial and email data, testing/training four different machine learning algorithms, optimizing their performance, and selecting the best algorithm. <br><br>To find out which algorithm performed the best, you can <a target="_blank" href="http://broadwater.io/identifying-fraud-from-enron-email">read my analysis here</a>, or look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidbroadwater/identifying-fraud-from-enron-email">code used</a> to create it. This project was completed as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002">Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree</a>.<br><br> Skills used: Python, Machine Learning, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Scikit-Learn, Feature Selection, Cross-Validation, Algorithm Evaluation/Selection, Text-Learning, NLTK.</p>
