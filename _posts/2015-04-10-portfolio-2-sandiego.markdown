This project involved applying data munging (or wrangling/cleaning) techniques on <a target="_blank" href="http://osm.org/go/TPTKToK">OpenStreetMap</a> data for an area of our choice. These techniques included assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, and then correcting the issues identified in the data. Finally, all of the cleaned data was imported into MongoDB and then queried to gain insights about the area.
